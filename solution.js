/* 
  in a conditional block with many choices, only 
  one - the FIRST to match - will be chosen. while 
  90 is technically both greater than 80 and greater 
  than 60, since the program will find the first 
  condition to be true, it will exit the conditional 
  block there. 

  this is a case where it's important to note what 
  order you put your conditions in. if we had put 60 
  first, we would get an unexpected log for a temp 
  like 90.

  additionally, you'll notice that below we just 
  put the `rain` variable in without ===. 
  javascript will evaluate whether `rain` is true
  or false since we put it in the if's parentheses. 
  in other words, `rain` and `rain === true` get
  evaluated the same way by javascript. 
  similarly, `!rain` and `rain === false` will be 
  evaluated the same.
